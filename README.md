# discord-minesweep
A script to generate boards of minesweeper in discord using python. Works line by line so copying and pasting a grid from https://danq.me/minesweeper/ works perfectly. Do note that Discord has an emote limit of 99 emotes per message. As such I've found that 11x9 (99 tiles) or 12x8 (96 tiles) grids work well. Output is placed into your clipboard and can then be pasted into Discord.
